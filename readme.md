First of all, Thinking with Create is greatly inspired by [Create: Above and Beyond](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-above-and-beyond)!

The modpack of course features the Create mod but has also many modern technology mods like
* Applied Energistics 2
* Modern Industrialization
* Tech Reborn
* Space Biomes 

and so on...

# About
The goal of this modpack is to combine modern thechnology mods with create. Currently this pack is in high development as not many things have changed.

The next thing, I'm working on is a quest book. The quest book should help you to guide through this modpack, but as this is a **invention themed modpack**, just as create: above and beyond, the questbook won't tell you HOW to build up your factory lines, it only shows you the basic machines and what they do.

## This is an Expert Modpack
That means, also vanilla recipes have been changed to fit into an expert style pack. 
Also like some already existing expert modpacks have done, I alos halved the output out of logs and the amount of sticks per craft.

## Why Fabric?
Because Fabric is newer, more modern, has better performance optimisation mods such as Sodium and Phosphor and is also out of the box more performant than forge.
The next reason, why I'm using Fabric, is because I want to use more unknown mods and Fabric mods are currently not that popular. But to be honest, the most important Forge mods are already working on fabric.
